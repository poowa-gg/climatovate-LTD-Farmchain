# Voice to Value — Pitch Deck Outline

> Use this as a speaker guide for a 10-minute pitch or a 10-slide deck.

---

## Slide 1: Title
**Voice to Value**
*Turn a farmer's voice into financial power.*
- Tagline + logo + team name
- Competition / event name

---

## Slide 2: The Problem (2 min)
- 1.7B unbanked adults globally; smallholder farmers are the largest excluded group
- Traditional banks require collateral, literacy, and physical presence
- Existing agri-fintech is app-based, English-only, smartphone-dependent
- Disabled farmers have **zero** accessible financial tools
- **Story hook:** *"Meet Amina. She grows millet in Kano. She's never been inside a bank…"*

---

## Slide 3: The Solution (2 min)
- Voice-first agricultural finance platform
- Speak in your language → get a credit score → receive a loan → get farming advice
- Works on **any phone** (USSD, KaiOS, Android)
- **Offline-first** — syncs when connectivity returns
- Blockchain-verified credit identity owned by the farmer

---

## Slide 4: How It Works (1.5 min)
```
Farmer speaks → ASR (speech-to-text) → Intent understood →
→ Credit score calculated → Loan disbursed to mobile wallet
→ Prescriptive farming advice delivered via voice
```
- Show the system architecture diagram (simplified)
- Emphasize: **no app download, no literacy, no collateral**

---

## Slide 5: Credit Scoring Innovation (1 min)
- No credit bureau needed
- Score built from: planting behavior, input purchases, cooperative standing, peer endorsements, repayment history
- All recorded on Hyperledger Fabric — portable, immutable, farmer-owned
- Graduated trust: start small ($20), grow with good behavior

---

## Slide 6: Accessibility & Inclusion (1 min)
- Designed for visually impaired, amputee, and mobility-limited farmers
- Voiceprint login (no passwords)
- Haptic feedback (vibration patterns)
- Audio-spatial navigation
- Women-specific features (private profiles, cooperative tools)
- **Demo moment:** show the visually-impaired user flow

---
