# Voice to Value — Executive Summary

## What We Do
Voice to Value is a voice-first agricultural finance platform that enables smallholder and disabled farmers to build an **Immutable Credit Passport**—a portable, blockchain-verified financial identity that they own—accessing zero-collateral microloans and the innovative **Harvest Rescue** flash-market, entirely through voice.

## The Problem
1.7 billion adults remain unbanked. Smallholder farmers — who feed 80% of the developing world — are systematically excluded from financial services because they lack collateral, literacy, formal documentation, and smartphone access. Existing agri-fintech solutions are app-based, English-only, and inaccessible to disabled users. The result: a $170B annual credit gap for smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa alone.

## Our Solution
- **Voice-native interface** — farmers interact by speaking in Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo, Twi, Swahili, or any supported language
- **Behavioral credit scoring** — no credit bureau needed; scores built from planting compliance, input purchases, cooperative standing, and peer endorsements
- **Credit Passport (Blockchain)** — A verified credit identity on Hyperledger Fabric, owned by the farmer and portable to any lender. Unlike traditional systems, we solve "vendor lock-in."
- **Harvest Rescue (Flash Sell)** — A "panic button" for perishables. Instant market matching for rotting crops ensures farmers recover 90% of value even when logistics fail.
- **Zero-collateral microloans** — disbursed to mobile wallets in <24 hours
- **Prescriptive farming AI** — personalized alerts on when to plant, irrigate, and harvest based on satellite weather data
- **Offline-first** — full functionality on USSD (any phone), with sync when connectivity returns
- **Accessibility-first** — voiceprint login, haptic feedback, audio-spatial navigation for disabled farmers

## Business Model
Five revenue streams ensure sustainability beyond grant funding:
1. **Loan facilitation fees** (2–3% per disbursement)
2. **SaaS licensing** to microfinance institutions
3. **B2B advisory channel** for agri-input companies
4. **Anonymized data insights** for insurers and governments
5. **Carbon credit facilitation** for climate-smart farming practices

**Target:** $1.5M ARR by Year 3 with 100,000+ farmers across 5 countries.
